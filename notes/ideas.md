# "Resource"

A "resource" is a single entity that is made up of actions and a single reducer. It's purpose is to handle the network requests (`GET`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`POST`/`DELETE`), their states (`REQUESTED`/`SUCCEEDED`/`FAILED`), and how all of that affects the application's state (in store).

An idea would be to have something like:

```js
// resources/index.js
import { createResource } from '@helpscout/unicorn'

createResource('posts')
createResource('post')
createResource('image')
```

The `createResource` function generates the necessary actionTypes, actions, and reducer and is automatically registered to the application's context + store (some how).

# Routes

Organized as an Array and the `react-router/Route` components are generated by Unicorn.

```jsx
import { createRoutes } from '@helpscout/unicorn'
import Home from '../screens/Home'
import Edit from '../screens/Edit'

const pageTitleBase = 'Unicorn'
const titleSeparator = '|'

// enhance with onEnter/onLeave
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    render: Home,
    page: {
      title: 'Home',
    },
  },
  {
    path: '/edit/:id',
    render: Edit,
    page: {
      title: props => {
        const { name } = props
        return `Editing ${name}`
      },
    },
  },
]

const redirects = [
  {
    from: '/woops',
    to: '/',
  },
]

export default createRoutes({
  routes,
  redirects,
  pageTitleBase,
  titleSeparator,
})
```

# CLI

Unicorn will have a CLI tool to help scaffold, generate, and test applications. Similar to what you'd get from Rails, Ember, and Angular.

## Generating components

```
uni generate component Hello
```

or

```
uni g c Hello
```

This generates the following files:

```
src/components/Hello/index.js
src/components/Hello/Hello.js
src/components/Hello/Hello.css.js
src/components/Hello/Hello.test.js
```

## Generating resources

```
uni generate resource images
```

or

```
uni g r images
```

This creates and adds the resource to the application:

```js
// resources/index.js
import { createResource } from '@helpscout/unicorn'

createResource('posts')
createResource('images') // <-- new
```
